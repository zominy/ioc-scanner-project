# Meeting 2

23 ‎August ‎2025, ‏‎10:23:12

## Overview

Attendance: Max, Ozzy, Michal.

#### Acknowledgements:

Max praised Ozzy for submitting the IOC loader 30 days early.

The code meets all requirements and works well, but needs minor polishing (typos, slightly bloated structure).

#### Cloning & Setup:

Michal hasn’t cloned the repository into VS Code yet.

Max will provide a tutorial to link VS Code with the repository for easy code updates and pushing changes to GitHub.

#### Progress Updates:

Michal: Focused on understanding SHA-256 and examining Python hash utilities; coding is in progress.

Ozzy: IOC loader mostly complete; minor polishing needed.

#### Upcoming Work & Deadlines (by 10th September):

Ozzy: Finish IOC loader polishing and start extension filter.

Michal: Begin hash utils, aiming for functional or partial completion.

Max: Start scanner development and integrate it with hash utils; depends on easy hash, useful hash utils, and IOC loader.

#### Blockers / Concerns:

No access or tool issues reported.

No deadline concerns; Michal expects to focus fully on the project once back at college.

#### Recap:

Ozzy: extension filter + polish

Michal: hash utils

Max: scanner development

Closing: Thanks to everyone for their time; check-ins will continue.

## Transcript

Max Z. 0:48
Okay, are we all here?

Ozzy A. 0:52
Yes.

Max Z. 0:54
Okay, perfect. So first, straight away, I want to acknowledge Ozzy's work on the IOC loader being submitted 30 days early, which gives us a lot of leeway. Looking at the code for the first time, really quickly, it meets every requirement that was originally in the file. What the file is actually meant to do is, like, totally fine. It meets all the requirements. However, it does need a little polishing. For example, there are a couple of typos in the comments, maybe the structure feels a bit bloated, or something like that. Anyway, it’s not a full code review—just some brief feedback to top it off; it’s barely anything. But it’s perfect. The code is really good, concise, and if an error comes up at some point, you shouldn’t have any problems fixing it.

As for cloning, Michal, have you cloned the repository into your VS Code? It’s fine if you haven’t yet.

Michal T. 2:09
Uh, no, not yet.

Max Z. 2:12
That’s fine. I’m going to put a tutorial up—I had one earlier, I think it was on how to clone the repository into VS Code. I need to stress that it’s really important because it links the repository and your VS Code together so you can make changes remotely. Also, for example, if you’re me, Michal, and you have to do hash utils, you go into the file, add your code, push it, and it will update GitHub, with all the paths staying the same, etc. So I’ll write a tutorial, and it’s important that people do that at some point.

Anyway, I’d like to ask, Michal, what have you been up to since the last meeting?

Michal T. 3:04
Mainly looking at how SHA-256 works—that was a primary focus. I’ve been coding the whole thing, which is obviously a pain. I looked at a hash loop, which is the hash utils… what would you call it, like, a library for Python, yep, and just generally how it works and what it contains.

Max Z. 3:27
Okay, well, that’s absolutely perfect. Good.

So in terms of upcoming work: Ozzy, all you need to do is polish off your IOC loader a little and start the extension filter at any point. You have until the 10th of September to finish those. Michal, you need to begin hash utils at some point. You have until the 10th of September to have something functional or partial.

For me, I’ll begin the scanner and try to integrate it with hash utils as well. The scanner does have a few dependencies: easy hash, useful hash utils, and the IOC loader. Obviously, the loader is done, so thanks again, Ozzy, but yeah, I’ll have to integrate with it and see what I can do.

Does anyone have any blockers at the moment, or tools/access issues that could impact your work?

Ozzy & Michal
No.

Max Z. 4:39
Okay, perfect. Any concerns about deadlines?

Michal T. 4:42
No, not really. Once we get back to college, I’ll basically be doing only this, so…

Max Z. 4:54
Well, it’s up to you, but much appreciated—it would benefit us a lot as long as you stay within schedule.

Short recap: Ozzy, extension filter and a little polish. Michal, hash utils. Me, scanner development. That’s really it.

If anyone has any questions… no? Sounds good. Okay, well, thanks for your time, thanks for being here. I’ll check in with you soon.

Ozzy A. 5:19
Yep. Thank you
